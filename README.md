# Autonomous Drone Navigation using Synaptic Resistor Circuits
Official implementation of autonomous drone control in dynamically changing wind environment using synaptic resistor circuits, human and deep Reinforcment Learning (RL) using Python and Tensorflow framework. Without any prior learning, a circuit of synaptic resistors integrating ferroelectric HfZrO material was demonstrated to navigate a drone toward a target position while avoiding obstacles in a simulated environment, exhibiting significantly superior learning speed, performance, power consumption, and adaptability compared to computer-based artificial neural networks. Synaptic resistor circuits enable efficient and adaptive Super-Turing AI systems in uncertain and dynamic real-world environments.
